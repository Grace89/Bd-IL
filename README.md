## Abstract: 
The disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has contributed to global amphibian declines. Bd infects the keratinized epidermal tissue in frogs and causes hyperkeratosis and excessive skin shedding. Consequently, the regulatory function of frog skin is disrupted resulting in an electrolyte depletion, osmotic imbalance, and eventually death. Safe and effective treatments for chytridiomycosis are urgently needed to control chytrid fungal infections and stabilize populations of endangered amphibian species in captivity and in the wild. Currently, the most widely used anti-Bd treatment is itraconazole. Preparations of itraconazole formulated for amphibian use has proved effective, but safe treatment involves short baths over seven to ten days, a process which is logistically challenging, stressful, and causes long-term health effects. Here, we explore a novel anti-fungal therapeutic using the ionic liquid, 1-Butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMP-NTf2), for the treatment of chytridiomycosis that requires a single application. BMP-NTf2 was found be effective at killing Bd in vitro at low concentrations (1:1000 dilution). We tested BMP-NTf2 in vivo on two amphibian species, one that is relatively tolerant of chytridiomycosis (Pseudacris regilla) and one that is highly susceptible (Dendrobates tinctorius). A toxicity trial revealed a surprising interaction between Bd infection status and the impact of BMP-NTf2 on D. tinctorius survival.  Uninfected D. tinctorius tolerated BMP-NTf2 (mean ± SE; 96.01 ± 9.00 µl/gram), such that only 1 out of X frogs died following treatment (at a dose of 156.95 µL/gram), whereas, a lower dose (mean ± SE; 102.99 ± 17.59 µl/gram) was not tolerated by Bd-infected D. tinctorius, where 15 of 23 frogs died immediately upon BMP-NTf2 application. Those that tolerated the BMP-NTf2 application did not exhibit Bd clearance. Thus, BMP-NTf2 application is not a safe or effective method for clearing Bd infection in this susceptible species. However, different results were obtained for P. regilla. Two topical applications of BMP-NTf2 on P. regilla (mean ± SE; 9.42 ± 1.43 µL/gram) reduced Bd growth, although the effect was lower than that obtained by daily doses of itracanozole (50% frogs exhibited complete clearance on day 16 vs. 100% for itracanozole). Our findings suggest that the potential for BMP-NTf2 to treat Bd infection in frogs is species-specific; further optimization of dose and schedule are needed.
